# Home Credit Risk Analysis
# Overview
This project, created by a team of 2, conducts an audit on the Home Credit Risk ADS, which is designed to predict loan repayment difficulties based on a Home Credit Default Risk dataset from a Kaggle competition. 
The goal is to enhance financial inclusion by identifying potential biases and ensuring fairness in the ADS used to evaluate subpopulations. 

# Objectives
- Evaluate ADS Performance: Use AUC/ROC curve and FPR rates.
- Assess Fairness: Use demographic parity and selection rates
- Assess Explainability: Initial a SHAP model
